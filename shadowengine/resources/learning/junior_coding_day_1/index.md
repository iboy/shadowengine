## What you will do

This day will be a robotics themed day whereby students will explore robotics using Ozobot, the line-following and programmable robot. The day will start by exploring the concept of line following using a series of paper-based challenges. Students will then move on to programming their Ozobot using Ozobot blockly and they will complete a series of fun challenges
