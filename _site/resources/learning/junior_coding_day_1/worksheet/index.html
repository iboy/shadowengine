          <h2 id="ice-breaker-20-minutes">Ice Breaker (20 minutes)</h2>

<p>Use your ice breaker sheet to select 2 appropriate Ice Breakers
Ensure that you speak to every student and get to know their names about their interests.</p>

<p>Try to relate one of the icebreakers to one of the weeks themes (Robotics, Animation, Mobile Apps, Games)</p>

<h2 id="robot-theory-10-minutes">Robot Theory (10 minutes)</h2>

<p>Begin by taking to the group about robotics. Use the Ozobot.pptx slideshow to assist you.
<strong>What makes a robot?</strong>
Ask the group if they know what a robot is, does anybody in the group own their own robot? 
Try to get answers from the group by using a call and response technique (Ask one of the students what they think a robot is, then use their response to fuel the discussion)
The answer you’re looking for should be something like: An automated machine designed to do something for humans, or to mimic human behaviour. (You can use Wikipedia for a more thorough description, but something like the above will suffice!)</p>

<p><strong>Why Robots?</strong>
Move on to discussing why we use robots, using the slideshow to assist. 
Ask the group why we might use robots and use their responses to further the discussion.</p>

<p>You’re looking for these answers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Doing something too dangerous for humans (working with radioactive waste, hazardous materials, extremely heavy lifting)</li>
  <li>Doing monotonous, repetitive tasks faster than humans are able to (Manufacturing, etc.)</li>
  <li>Making human lives easier (Automating menial tasks, providing assistance, etc.)</li>
  <li>Doing something that humans can’t do (Exploring planets, space, the deep ocean, etc.)</li>
  <li>Doing something that humans don’t <em>want</em> to do.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also accept any answers that aren’t written down here! You’re just trying to get the group thinking about robots!</p>

<h2 id="activity-10-minutes">Activity (10 Minutes)</h2>

<p><strong>Hello Ozobot!</strong>
Using what you just discussed, introduce the group to Ozobot!
If you haven’t already, give out the Ozobots to the group (1 bot per 2 students).
Begin be showing the group how to turn the Ozobot on (By pressing the small button on the left-hand-side of the robot). After the robots are turned on, give the students a few minutes to test out the Ozobot using the demo sheets provided (Demosheet1.1.pdf, Demosheet1.2.pdf).</p>

<p>After the group have tested the Ozobots on the demo sheets, get the group to power their bots off (by pressing the power button once).</p>

<h2 id="activity-how-does-the-ozobot-see-20-minutes">Activity: How does the Ozobot see? (20 Minutes)</h2>

<p>Ask the group how the Ozobot knows to follow black lines on the demo sheets. 
They should hopefully give you the answer – The Ozobot uses sensors to detect the lines, and it has been programmed to follow them!</p>

<p>Explain that the Ozobot uses something called an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) sensor to detect colours. Get the group to look at the bottom of their Ozobot, they should see 5 small slits in the bottom, this is where the RGB sensor is.</p>

<p>RGB sensors have 3 distinct parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A RGB Filter</li>
  <li>A Photodiode</li>
  <li>A converter.</li>
</ul>

<p>The light sensor works by shining a white light at an object and then recording the reflected colour. It can also record the intensity of the reflection (brightness). Through red, green and blue colour filters the photodiode converts the amount of light to current. The converter then converts the current to voltage which our Ozobot can read.</p>

<p>We know that the Ozobot can see black, white and colours, but it can also recognise sequential blocks of colour and it will change its behaviour depending on the colours it sees. We call this Ozocode, and it is a type of programming! Albeit a simple one.</p>

<p>Hand out some blank paper, worksheet1.1 and the Ozocode cheatsheets and get the group to experiment with different Ozocodes by drawing lines for the Ozobot to follow, along with different Ozocodes to change the bot’s behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="activity-challenges-20-minutes">Activity: Challenges (20 Minutes)</h2>

<p>After the group has tested out the Ozobots and Ozocode, hand out worksheet1.2.</p>

<p>Challenge the students to fill in the blank spots with Ozocode to get Ozobot from the “Home” position to the “Fire Tech Camp” logo on the sheet. They can only use Ozocode, not draw black lines to complete the challenge.</p>

<p>Give the group about 10 minutes to solve this challenge, then hand out worksheet1.3.</p>

<p>Challenge the students to guide Ozobot from his house to the post office.</p>

<p>The group can draw black lines but they are not allowed to draw lines over the “river”.</p>

<p>The group have to use the following Ozocodes to complete the challenge, and they can only use each code once!</p>

<p><strong>Codes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>U-Turn</li>
  <li>Slow</li>
  <li>Jump Left</li>
  <li>Fast</li>
</ul>

<p>If the group complete this challenge easily then get them to move onto Advancedworksheet1.1</p>

<p>The rules are the same as worksheet1.3 but they have to use the codes below to go from Home, to the Shop, then to the post office without drawing lines over the river.</p>

<p><strong>Codes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>ZigZag</li>
  <li>U-Turn</li>
  <li>Fast</li>
  <li>Jump Right</li>
  <li>Slow</li>
</ul>

<p>Give the group around 15-20 minutes to complete these challenges, then move onto the next section.</p>

<h2 id="programming-theory-10-minutes">Programming Theory (10 Minutes)</h2>

<p><strong>Programming a robot</strong></p>

<p>Discuss programming with the group by asking questions like: What is programming? What language to computers/robots speak? How do we tell robots/computers what to do?</p>

<p>Programming is essentially just giving a series of commands to a computer, to make it do something!</p>

<p>Computers will always follow our instructions exactly as they are given. If a computer isn’t behaving as expected then its usually a problem with the way it was programmed.</p>

<p>Demonstrate this by “programming” one of the group to walk around the room and then high five another student. 
Ask for a volunteer from the group, this student will be the “robot” that the rest of the group have to program to complete the task.</p>

<p>Get the group to give the “robot” student instructions in order for them to walk around the room and high-five another student. Remind the “robot” student that they have to follow their instructions <em>exactly</em>. Computers don’t know how to improvise.</p>

<p>**Example instructions: **
Walk forward: This will make the “robot” walk forward, forever! Because we didn’t tell it to stop, nor did we tell it how far to work forward.</p>

<p>Turn right: This will make the “robot” turn right, forever! Because we didn’t tell it how far to turn.</p>

<p>Raise your arm: This will make the “robot” raise their arm as high as they possibly can, because we didn’t tell the robot how high to raise their arm.</p>

<p>After you complete this exercise, the group can use their computers or tablets to go to <a href="www.ozoblockly.com">www.ozoblockly.com</a>. This is where we will be programming our Ozobots!</p>

<h2 id="programming-activity-50-minutes">Programming Activity (50 minutes)</h2>

<p>Students will use the Shape tracer 1 &amp; 2 games to explore the basics of blocky coding:</p>

<p><a href="http://games.ozoblockly.com/?game=shapetracer-advanced&amp;lang=en">http://games.ozoblockly.com/?game=shapetracer-advanced&amp;lang=en</a></p>

<p>Do the first 2 tasks together so that students become familiar with the interface.</p>

<p>Stop the students to explain any concepts that they seem to struggle with (any tasks that they get stuck on)</p>

<h2 id="recap-10-minutes">Recap (10 minutes)</h2>

<p>Explore through questioning how to program their Ozobot, what types of instructions can you give it, what happens if the instructions are not in order etc</p>

<p>Ask the group to program their Ozobot to draw some simple geometric shapes. Start with a square then move onto more complex shapes such as pentagons, octagons, etc.</p>

<p>If the group are finding shapes too easy, challenge them to spell out their initials using the Ozobot.</p>

<h2 id="theory-and-activity-loops-25-minutes">Theory and Activity: Loops (25 minutes)</h2>

<p>Loops
Ask the groups how many lines of code they used to make their Ozobot draw a square. (Most students will have used 8 lines (Move forward, turn right x 4). Ask the group if they can make this more efficient by using fewer lines of code.</p>

<p>Explain that in programming we can use “loops” to make a compute repeat something forever or a certain number of times.</p>

<p>Using loops we can make the Ozobot draw a square using only three lines of code.</p>

<p><img src="/resources/learning/junior_coding_day_1/images/loop.png" alt="Loop in Scratch" /></p>

<p>Explain that in programming we use loops to make our code more efficient and to save us from having to repeat the same lines of code over and over again.</p>

<p>Get the group to experiment with loops using Ozoblockly. Get them to use loops to draw shapes, then, using another loop, get them to trace the shape in reverse using as few lines as possible.</p>

<h2 id="activity-ozobots-big-day-out-2-hours">Activity: Ozobot’s Big Day Out (2 hours)</h2>

<p>Now we know how to program our Ozobot, we can begin Ozobot’s big day out! Over the next few hours the group will program their Ozobot to dance, go bowling, solve a maze and even recreate a famous movie scene!</p>

<p><strong>Dancing (Wait function &amp; timing)</strong>
Get the group to choose a song for their Ozobot to dance to! Feel free to choose a suitable song yourself if you prefer or if you find this unmanageable.</p>

<p>The students will have to work in groups of 4 (2 Ozobots per group) in order to coordinate their
bots to dance to the first part of the song.</p>

<p>Show the group the “Wait” function in Ozoblockly, they can use this to make their Ozobot dance in time to the music!</p>

<p>Give the group around 20 minutes to program their bot and then gather up the groups to “Dance-Off” to the chosen song.</p>

<p><strong>Bowling (Loops &amp; measuring distances)</strong></p>

<p>After the dance-off, hand out the bowling pins from the teacher’s kit (Don’t hand out the balls!).</p>

<p>Get the group to set up the bowling pins as per the bowling.pdf handout. After the pins are set up, challenge the group to program their Ozobot to knock down as many pins as possible. 
Use the bowlingscore.pdf sheet to keep track of their attempts!</p>

<p>Encourage the group to measure how far the Ozobot will have to travel and encourage the use of loops to make their code more efficient.</p>

<p>Give the group around 25 minutes on this challenge including practice time (allowed 2 dry runs)</p>

<p><strong>Movie scenes</strong></p>

<p>Time to get creative and use the Ozobot to act out famous movie scenes. Speak about Disney movies etc and their favourite scences – you can use youtube to show them</p>

<p>The students may need to work in groups of 4 (2 Ozobots per group) in order to recreate the scenes. They can use paper to build props and sets</p>

<p>Give the group around 25 minutes on this challenge</p>

<h2 id="activity-maze-mastery-40-minutes">Activity: Maze Mastery (40 minutes)</h2>

<p>Show the more advanced features of Ozoblockly by getting them to program the bot to follow lines, instead of just using the default program.</p>

<p>By using level 4 of the Ozobot editor you will be able to alter the Ozobot’</p>

<p>Start with Maze1 then move onto Maze2 or 3 depending on the ability of your group.</p>

<h2 id="tidy-up-5-minutes">Tidy Up (5 minutes)</h2>

<p>Collect in all Fire Tech resources and count the Ozobots to make sure none have gone missing</p>

<p>Throw away any used sheets etc</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up-20-minutes">Wrap Up (20 Minutes)</h2>

<p>Chose a plenary from the plenary sheets</p>

<h2 id="code-listing-and-keyboard-glyph-test">Code Listing and Keyboard Glyph Test</h2>

<p>Example keyboard glyphs:  Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>, <kbd>ALT</kbd>, and <kbd>DELETE</kbd>,</p>

<p>Example code listing:</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>My page<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
